All characters in the TV Series of Kamen Rider Blade (仮面ライダー剣 in 2004).

I inherit the work from the first training session in InternLM (书生·浦语) in 2024 to build this system.

This is a repository for building the agent system that enables chatting features with the copies the stage.

It mirrors my understanding towards a large part of my life so far, while working as an AI project that attempts to chain my learning path in computer science over the years too.
