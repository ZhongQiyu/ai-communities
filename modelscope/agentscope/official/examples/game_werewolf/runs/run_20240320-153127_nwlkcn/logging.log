Player1: I noticed Player4 was quite quick to agree with the majority yesterday. Maybe they're trying to blend in and not draw attention to themselves. What do you guys think?
Player2: I agree with Player1. I also noticed that Player4 was quick to go with the flow yesterday. It seemed a bit suspicious to me.
Player4: I understand your suspicions, but I assure you, I'm just a villager trying to survive. I agreed with the majority yesterday because I thought it was the best decision based on the information we had. But now, I'm starting to suspect both of you. You're quick to point fingers but haven't provided any solid evidence.
Player5: I also think Player4's behavior was a bit suspicious yesterday. But we need to be careful and make sure we're not being manipulated by the werewolves.
Player6: I agree that Player4's behavior was a bit suspicious. But we need to be careful. Player1 and Player2, you were quick to accuse. Do you have any solid evidence against Player4? Or are you trying to divert attention from yourselves?
